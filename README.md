WeatherPy Analysis
1. We can see from our plots that there is a strong correlation between temperature and latitude.  The further the latitude gets      from 0, the lower the temperature gets.
2. There are stronger correlation coefficients for cities in the Northern hemisphere than in the Southern Hemisphere.  This is        most likely because far south of the equator there are fewer cities.
3. Wind speed and humidity don't appear to be dependent on latitude.

VacationPy Observations:
1. With our heat map we observe that cities that fall on the coast have significantly higher humidity.
2. After we narrow down our cities to have ideal weather, all of our results fall relatively close to the equator.
3.
